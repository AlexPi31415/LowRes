# LowRes
Low resolution images without upscaling - the change happened because of some services became paid. Sorry about that. From April 2023 all published images will be in this resolution. You can try and find a free upscaling service for a limited number of pictures. To upscale the whole collection seems unreasonable.

All images are available for FREE. They are AI generated. 

To download: either use git clone, or you can click on the large green button, then select Download ZIP, finally, unzip all files on your local computer.

Enjoy!
